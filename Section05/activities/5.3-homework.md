2. Create a list of at least 5 elements of mixed data types
    - replace a part of it with something else

    - find and print the length of the list
    - slice a sub-section of the 1st list, and save it to a different 2nd list
    - extend your original list with the sub-section sliced above
    - sort and print your 1st sorted list
    - copy your list to another 3rd list
    - reverse and print the 3rd copied list
    - add the 2nd and 3rd lists together into a 4th list

    - multiply your tuple by 3
    - access and print the 12th element from the tuple
    - copy 4 specific elements from your 1st tuple to a new 2nd tuple
    - create a 3rd tuple with single item 50 and print this tuple
    - unpack the 2nd tuple into 4 variables and print these variables
    - modify the 1st tuple by replacing one of the elements with your name
    - programmatically find and print the index of your name
    - sort the elements in your 1st tuple
    - add the 2nd and 3rd tuple together into a 4th tuple and print the 4th tuple

4. Create a set of about 3 elements
    - add your 2nd list to it and print the result
    - add a car element to your set
    - create 2 sets of fruits with 3 elements each
    - save the union of sets 2 and 3 to a forth set
    - clear the 3rd set and print the result
    - remove an element from the 2nd set, and print the result
    - discard an element from the 4th set, and print the result
    - pop and element of the 4th set, and print the result

5. Create a dictionary with at least 5 values of different data types
    - print out 1 value
    - replace any one value in your dictionary with your name
    - add your favorite color to the dictionary
    - add a list, tuple or set to your dictionary
    - print a list of the dictionary keys
    - print a list of the dictionary values
    - copy your 1st dictionary into a 2nd dictionary
    - pop an item from the 2nd dictionary, and print the dictionary
    - remove all the elements from the 2nd dictionary and print the result
