# Contributing to the Data Analytics & Python curriculum

We welcome contributions from everyone and appreciate your consideration in helping us to improve our documentation.  

## Sprints

We work in 12 week sprints that align from the cohort Demo Day to cohort Demo Day.

Enhancement and Bug Issues are created in the respective project repositories under the Issues tab.

Each issue will be placed in the appropriate swimlane and prioritized on a routine basis as meeting times allow.

## Issue reporting

We encourage people to report issues whether a bug or enhancement. The most important advice from there is:

1. Do as thorough a search as you can to see whether the issue has already been reported
1. Be as precise and complete as you can when reporting a new issue.

### To report a issue

- Go to the appropriate project.
- Click the Issues button on the left of the window.
- Click the "New issue" button.
- Fill out the Title and the prepopulated template within Description.
- Assign the appropriate labels (Bug or Enhancement are required)
- Assign the Projects to 'DAP Curriculum'
- Leave Milestone as 'No Milestone' unless otherwise directed

After you create an issue, the team will assign a priority to the issue, ensure it is labeled properly, and perhaps request additional information from you.

## Select an issue

Please review the issues on the [DAP Curriculum kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/savvy-coders/projects/3) and select an issue.

### The columns in the kanban board are as follows:
<dl>
  <dt>Ideas</dt>
  <dd>A swimlane for issues that are considered ideas but not worked until additional debate and consideration</dd>
  <dt>Intake</dt>
  <dd>A swimlane for issues that are for future sprints or that need further details added</dd>
  <dt>Backlog</dt>
  <dd>A swimlane for issues in the current sprint backlog.   These are the issues that should be worked from top to bottom.  This swimlane should be prioritized by the team during a sprint planning that occurs during a curriculum meeting.</dd>
  <dt>In Progress</dt>
  <dd>A swimlane for issues currently being worked by a team member.  As an issue is assigned to themselves by a team member when they decide to pick up the issue it should be moved the In Progress</dd>
  <dt>In Review</dt>
  <dd>A swimlane for issues that the work has been completed and a pull request created</dd>
  <dt>Done</dt>
  <dd>A swimlane for issues that have been had the pull request reviewed, approved and merged</dd>
</dl>

It is preferred that you select an issue from as near the top of the swimlane, assuming you are comfortable with the topic.
