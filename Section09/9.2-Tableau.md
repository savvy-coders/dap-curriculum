# TABLEAU (CONT.)
---
## AGGREGATION
- The process of converting a set of values into a single value (ex. Sum, Average, Median)
- Done based on Measures and Dimensions
- Aggregating Measures can be added to relational data sources
- Aggregating Dimensions can be done by Minimum, Maximum, Count or Count(Distinct)

<br>

### Let’s Try it Using the Sample Superstore Data:
- Drag “Sales” to "Rows", "Columns", or "Text" (located inside the Marks pane)
- The default selected aggregation is "SUM"
- Right-click on "SUM(Sales)"
- Navigate to "Measure(SUM)" and select the desired aggregation from the list
- You can change the default aggregation of any measure by clicking on a measure within the Data Pane (located on the far left-hand side), select "Default Properties" > "Aggregation" and then select one

<br>

## PIVOTS
- Allow you to select columns that need to be manipulated and transform them into a row for data manipulation
- MUST pivot from Columns to Rows (tall vs. wide)
### To create a pivot:
- Select all desired columns in the preview pane
- Right-click and select pivot from pop-up menu

<br>

## The Data interpreter
- Automatically cleans and prepares data​
- Available under the Connections Pane in Data Source View whenever a unique format is detected

<br>

## SPLITTING COLUMNS
- The "Split" function is used to split a column into multiple ones​
- Example: Moving “City, State: Denver, CO” to two different cells​
- It's used to make data analysis easier​
- It offers both Automatic Split and Custom Split​
    - Automatic: Done by detecting a common separator ​
    - Custom: Allows a max of 10 new fields based on a separator in original field​
### To Split a Column:
- Right-click on the desired column in preview pane and select "Split"

<br>

## DATA TYPES WITHIN TABLEAU
- Are automatically assigned by Tableau upon importing a new data source, but can be manually assigned as well
- Include:
    - Text Values​
    - Numerical Values
    - Date Values​
    - Date and Time Values​
    - Boolean Values
    - Geographic Values
- Can be manually assigned from the preview pane by clicking on the icon at the top of each column, or via the "Fields" pane on the left-hand side

<br>

---
## DATA ROLES
### Dimensions vs. Measures​
- Data in Tableau can be both text-based or numerical, and is automatically segregated into either role​
- Dimensions - produce a header when added to row/column, categorical​
- Measures - produce an axes when added to row/column, numeric​
### Discrete vs. Continuous​ Data
- Every field is categorized as either discrete or continuous​

<br>

Discrete Data: Notice how every quantity has a header at the bottom
<br>

<br>

Continuous Data: Notice how quantity values are shown in a continuous axis

## WORKING WITH METADATA
- Metadata from your datasets can be manipulated directly in Tableau
- Examples:
    - Rename: sheets, column names
    - Hide: columns you don’t want to use
    - Duplicate: sheets, columns

<br>

---
## WORKING WITH DEFAULT FIELDS
### Adding a comment to a field:
- You can view a comment when you put your cursor over the field​
- Right-click on a field > select "Default Properties"​ > select "Comment​"

### Changing a whole number field to a decimal (and vis versa):
- Right-click on a field, > select "Default Properties​" > select "Number Format​" > select "Number"​ > set "Decimal Places" to the desired value
### Changing The Fiscal Year:
- Right click on a field​ > select "Default Properties"​ > "Fiscal Year Start"​ > select desired month from the drop-down menu

<br>

---
## CREATING ALIASES
- Individual data points and be given aliases in Tableau
- Right-click on any column and select "Aliases​"
- Update the Alias name and click "OK"​
- Second Class would be where you would rename

<br>

# FILTERING DATA
## DIMENSION FILTERS
- Allow you to filter data by dimension type
- Types of dimension filters:
    - General: selects one or multiple members from the domain​
    - Wildcard: Matches values based on the presence of a string, the same starting and ending characters, or the same set of characters.​
    - Condition: Matches values based on field or formula​
    - Top: Highlights top values by field or formula​

<br>
