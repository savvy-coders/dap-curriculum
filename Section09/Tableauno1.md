### TABLEAU BREAKDOWN

- Each graph should require a NEW worksheet & make sure they are named properly
- Dashboards are preps for your STORY (aka presentation) 
- Think of each Dashboard as a “slide” where you put your STORY together. Make sure to name them properly
- Your STORY is your presentation of how you want to show your Dashboards (aka slides)

### LET'S PRACTICE

- Plot SALES against CATEGORY, SEGMENT & ORDER DATE
- Make it a line graph
- Filter down to Home Office for each segment
- Delete top title
- Make it a bar graph
- Rename it “Home Office Sales”

### 8 TOOLS TO PREPARE DATA FOR ANALYSIS

- JOINS
- RELATIONSHPS 
- UNIONS
- DATA BLEANDING
- AGGREGATIONS
- PIVOT
- DATA INTERPRETER
- SPLIT

### JOINS

Combine data in order to filter and get rid of duplicates

- Left Join
- Right Join
- Inner Join
- Full Outer Join

1. Connect to the Super-Store dataset
2. Move "Orders' and click Open
3. Right-click on "Orders' and click Open
4. Move "Returns" over to the canvas
        - This creates an inner join BY DEFAULT
5. Select the correct join

Tableau will identify the primary key for joining two or more data sets together

- Left Join: values from LEFT Table & match to RIGHT Table
- Right Join: values from RIGHT Table & matchto LEFT Table
- Inner Join: includes common data present in BOTH datasets
- Full Outer Join: includes ALL values from both tables

### RELATIONSHIPS

- Created when you drag more than one sheet over
- Think of it as a contract between two tables
- No joining
- Automatic & contrext aware
- Flexible

---

## JOINS vs RELATIONSHIPS

### UNIONS

Helps bring together data from multiple small files into one large one.

1. Connect to dataset
2. Drag over needed sheet
3. Drag over another to overlap (you'll see "union")
4. Overlapping icon

### Data Blending

Tableau combines related data from multiple sources in a single view

1. Connect two sources (Superstore & GLobal Superstore)
2. Click on Data table & "Edit Blend Relationships"
3. Choose "Segment" and "OK"
4. Drag "Profit" from both sets over to Columns
5. Drag "Segment" from Global Superstore over to Rows

### Blend 

- Used to combine data from different databases that don't support joins
- Data within databases are at different levels of detail
- Joins = duplicate rows
- Involves large amount of data

### Join

- Data format is consistent across ALL sources
- Involves small amounts of data
- Data is at the same level of detail across sources
