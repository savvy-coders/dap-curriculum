## Find someone outside of SavvyCoders to discuss your progress in the cohort with.

## The requirements for these discussions are:
  - Use the learning objectives in the curriculum so you can speak to what you have learned
  - Show your homework and talk through it / how you did it
  - Mention “blockers” (problems/issues) you are facing with the work and your personal “bootcamp management” (time/study habits, distractions etc.)
  - Keep the conversation with your review person short around 10-15 mins
  - Make a “report-back” to your TA even shorter, max 3 mins if verbally or write a review in Slack to your TA
<br>

## The guidelines for these discussions are:
  - Take notes from the person you are soliciting feedback from to use to send to your TA
  - This is to be completed and turned in to your TA every other Tuesday before class
  - This will be done the day before the retrospectives so follow the class schedule
  - The person you are reviewing your sprint with could be a family member, friend, user of your application you are building.
  - Your notes should include each bullet point from above and the feedback from your dedicated person.

## **How to turn in your feedback from sprint review:** You can do this via zoom session with your TA at a scheduled meeting OR type up your notes from your sprint review with the feedback and send to your TA.
