    "\n",
    "- **Sequential** - Sequential statements are a set of statements whose execution process happens in a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Selection** - selection statements are also known as Decision control statements or branching statements. This allows a program to test several conditions and execute instructions based on which condition is true.\n",

    "\n",
    "Programs are rarely linear.\n",
