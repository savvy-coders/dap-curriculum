    "### What is an Array?\n",
    "\n",
    "An array is basically a data structure which can hold more than one value at a time. It is a collection or ordered series of elements of the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. \n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element in memory, by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    car1 = \"Ford\"\n",
    "    car2 = \"Volvo\"\n",
    "    car3 = \"BMW\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300?\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is an array!\n",
    "\n",
    "An array can hold many values -- in square brackets -- under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # Create an array containing car names\n",
    "    cars = [\"Ford\", \"Volvo\", \"BMW\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "_Arrays are most useful when we have to manipulate values of only one specific data type_. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Python does not have built-in support for Arrays, but there are other ways to implement the benefits of Arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays could be handled in Python by a module named `array`. If we create arrays using the `array` module, all elements of the array must be of the same data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not examine the `Array` module any further as it's complexities are beyond the scope of this curriculum.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also treat `list`s as arrays. _However, lists and arrays are not the same thing._\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What's the Difference between Python Lists and Python Arrays?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists and arrays behave similarly. Just like lists, arrays are an ordered sequence of elements. Both are also mutable and not fixed in size, which means iItems can be added and removed, making them very flexible to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference lies in the data types that can be stored: Lists store items that are of various data types, while arrays store only elements of the same data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to read more about the Python array method, here is a FreeCodeCamp.com article on the topic ... [Python Array Tutorial â€“ Define, Index, Methods](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-array-tutorial-define-index-methods/)\n",

    "### Review: Python Lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Lists, like arrays in other programming languages, can be used to store multiple items in a single variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A `List` is an ordered sequence of values separated by commas, and enclosed in square brackets `[ ]`.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    fruitList = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### List Items \n",
    "\n",
    "- List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.\n",
    "- When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will generally  not change.\n",
    "- The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.\n",
    "- List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.\n",
    "- Since lists are indexed, lists can have duplicate items with the same value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Operations on List\n",
    "\n",
    "We learned that there are numerous operations that can be performed on lists like ...\n",
    "- getting the length\n",
    "- accessing elements by index\n",
    "- extending and changing lists\n",
    "- adding and repeating lists\n",
