1. Write a simple function that takes 2 parameters -- a  first name and a day name. 

    - Set a default value for the day name of Sunday.
    - Have the function print out a greeting -- using the parameters -- that says something like "Hi first-name! Happy day-name!". Remember to use the variables in the greeting to replace first-name and day-name.
