    "\n",
    "Like in most programming environments, we do not need to, or want to constantly reinvent the wheel! \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the pre-written code chunks of those who've gone before us to more efficiently write our own programs -- reducing having to rewrite a lot of code from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world programs  and applications are complex. Even a simple game like a dice roll simulator would require lots of code if you programmed everything from scratch. \n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the process and make it more effective, developers leverage modular programming ‚Äì a method of breaking large coding tasks into smaller, more manageable subtasks or bytes. (LOL, programmer humor  üòÑ )\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why Python has so many modules, packages, libraries, and frameworks that we can use to help us.\n"

    "![Top Python Libraries](./images/PythonLibraries.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python **Modules**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want your code to be well organized, it‚Äôs a good idea to start by grouping related code. A module is basically a bunch of related code saved in a file with the extension \"`.py`\".\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different modules like ...\n",
    "\n",
    "- **<span style='background:yellow'><span style='color:Darkblue'>random module</span></span>** -- to generate pseudo-random number generators for various distributions\n",
    "- **html module** --  to parse HTML pages\n",
    "- **<span style='background:yellow'><span style='color:Darkblue'>datetime module</span></span>** -- to manipulate date and time data\n",
    "- **re module** --  to detect and parse regular expressions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python **Packages**\n",
    "\n",
    "When developing a large application, you may end up with many different modules. You'll benefit from grouping and organizing your modules into packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be considered a package (or subpackage), a directory must contain a file named \"`__init__.py`\". This file usually includes the initialization code for the corresponding package.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of built-in and open-source Python packages. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **<span style='background:yellow'><span style='color:Darkblue'>NumPy</span></span>** --  is the fundamental Python package for scientific computing\n",
    "- **<span style='background:yellow'><span style='color:Darkblue'>pandas</span></span>** -- is a Python package for fast and efficient processing of tabular data, time series, matrix data, etc.\n",
    "- **pytest** --  provides a variety of modules to test new code, including small unit tests or complex functional tests\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python **Libraries**\n",
    "\n",
    "A library is an umbrella term referring to a reusable chunk of code. Usually, a Python library contains a collection of related modules and packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, this term is often used interchangeably with ‚ÄúPython package‚Äù because packages can also contain modules and other packages (subpackages). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, _it is often assumed that while a package is a collection of modules, a library is a collection of packages_.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are OVER 137,000 Python Libraries, and growing! Some of the libraries are ...\n",
    "\n",
    "- **<span style='background:yellow'><span style='color:Darkblue'>Matplotlib</span></span>** -- is a standard library for generating data visualizations in Python. It supports building basic two-dimensional graphs as well as more complex animated and interactive visualizations\n",
    "- **PyTorch** -  is an open-source deep-learning library built by Facebook‚Äôs AI Research lab to implement advanced neural networks and cutting-edge research ideas in industry and academia\n",
    "- **pygame** -- provides developers with tons of convenient features and tools to make game development a more intuitive task\n",
    "- **Beautiful Soup** -- is a very popular Python library for getting data from the web. The modules and packages inside this library help extract useful information from HTML and XML files. The definitive library for web-scrapping\n",
    "- **Requests** --  is a part of a large collection of libraries designed to make Python HTTP requests simpler. The library offers an intuitive JSON method that helps you avoid manually adding query strings to your URLs.\n",
    "- **missingno** -- is very handy for handling missing data points. It provides informative visualizations about the missing values in a dataframe, helping data scientists to spot areas with missing data. (It's just one of many great libraries for data cleaning)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python **Frameworks**\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to libraries, Python frameworks are a collection of modules and packages that help programmers to fast track the development process. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, frameworks are usually more complex than libraries. Also, while libraries contain packages that perform specific operations, frameworks contain the basic flow and architecture of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you compare application development to building a house, Python frameworks provide all the essential building blocks like the foundation, walls, windows, roof, plumbing and electricity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then developers build their application around this framework by adding functionalities comparable to interior design, an alarm system, furniture, appliances, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some popular application development **Frameworks** are ...\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Django** --  a framework for building web applications with all the necessary features included by default\n",
    "- **Flask** -- a web development framework that is known for its lightweight and modular design. It has many out-of-the-box features and is easily adaptable to specific requirements\n",
    "- **Bottle** -- is another lightweight framework for web development that was originally meant for building APIs. Its unique features are that it has no dependencies other than the Python Standard Library and it implements everything in a single source file\n",

    "\n",
    "If we want to use code from a module or a library in our applications, we first need to import the respective module into our code-base. by using the import statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "It‚Äôs common to have many different items defined within the same module. So, you may want to import only one specific function rather than the entire module.
