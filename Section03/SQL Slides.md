# What is a database

## According to Oracle:

A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.  

Before the adoption of RDBMS systems flat files were often used for each table.

In Excel each tab could be thought of as a table and the workbook itself as a database.

In a modern DBMS the meta-data is also in tables, row, and columns.

# SQL 

## Structured Query Language

Structured Query language came along as a methodology to simplify data retrieval from relational databases. 
SQL's advent created a paradigm shift away from rows to set based operations. 
It changed everything.

# Database Types

## Relational

- Data is stored in tables and the relationships between the tables can be defined and enforced by the DBMS. 
- Transactional integrity, if a transaction will update more than one table then all updates must succeed or the transaction will be rolled back. 
- Relational databases are most commonly used for transactional systems. 

---

## NoSQL

- Data can be stored in many different formats in a NoSQL environment. 
	- Common formats include: tables, json, and XML and BLOB
- Grew out of the need to capture tremendously high volume data flows
- Commonly used in experimental analytics.

---

# Standard Data Types

Char - a fixed length string
Varchar - variable length string
Integer - whole numbers (can be signed or unsigned)
Float - a floating point number (used for scientific calculations - do not use for financial calculations)
Decimal - a fixed-point number

NULL - is not a datatype

# SQLite Datatypes

## Storage Classes and Datatypes

Each value stored in an SQLite database (or manipulated by the database engine) has one of the following storage classes:

-   **NULL**. The value is a NULL value.
-   **INTEGER**. The value is a signed integer, stored in 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 bytes depending on the magnitude of the value.
-   **REAL**. The value is a floating point value, stored as an 8-byte IEEE floating point number.
-   **TEXT**. The value is a text string, stored using the database encoding (UTF-8, UTF-16BE or UTF-16LE).
-   **BLOB**. The value is a blob of data, stored exactly as it was input.

# Exercise One - SQLite 

Prerequisites: 
- SQLite - https://www.sqlite.org/download.html
- DB Browser for SQLite - https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/

Many IDEs exist for manipulating SQL databases
- HeidiSQL
- VS Code Extensions
- Commercial products like dbForge

---

## New Database

From the SQLite terminal:
1. Open SQLite.exe
	1. Microsoft does not recognize this program and will warn you.
2. You will start in "in memory" mode - this database is destroyed when the program closes.
3. Use `.backup practice` to save the file to disk.

## Create tables

### Departments
- DepartmentId Int Primary Key
- DepartmentName Text

``` sql 
create table Departments(DepartmentId int, DepartmentName text)`
```

https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html

---

## Create tables 2

### Subjects
- SubjectId Int Primary Key
- SubjectName Text
- DepartmentId Int

### Students
- StudentId Int Primary Key
- StudentName Text 

### Grades
- StudentId Int Primary Key
- SubjectId Int
- Grade Int

_You might want to wait on creating these... there may be a better way in another slide or two..._

---

## Inserting Data

``` sql
insert into Departments(DepartmentId, DepartmentName) values(1, "IT");

insert into Departments(DepartmentId, DepartmentName) values(2, "Arts"),(3,"Spanish");

insert into Departments(DepartmentId, DepartmentName) values(4, "History"),(5,"Science"),(6, "Band"),(7,"StudyHall");
```

# Exercise 2 - DBBrowser

## Open DB Browser
- Open Database and select `practice.sqlite`
- Click on create table and type out the column names, datatype, and attributes for each of the remaining tables. 
- DB Browser creates the code for you:

``` sql
CREATE TABLE "Subjects" (
	"SubjectId"	INTEGER,
	"SubjectName"	TEXT,
	"DepartmentID"	INTEGER,
	PRIMARY KEY("SubjectId")
);
```

## Do this for the remaining tables
- Students and Grades

### Grades

| SubjectId | StudentId | Grade |
| --------- | --------- | ----- |
| 1         | 1         | 85    |
| 3         | 1         | 90    |
| 6         | 1         | 78    |
| 2         | 2         | 99    |
| 4         | 2         | 87    |

|           |           |       |
...

There would be many more records to enter here but I think everyone is ready to move on.

# Break

## Some questions to think about:
1. Where are the relationships?
2. Can you think of a reason why I am about to use the word, "Intersection"
3. Why doesn't the Grades table have a primary key
	1. What makes this table special?
	2. Could / Should it have a primary key

# Welcome Back

# Testing your tables:

``` sql

select * from Departments; 

select * from Subjects;

select * from Students;

select * from Grades;

```

---

# Updating data

Stephen only let's his mom call him that... we need to change his name to Steve.

``` sql

select * from students;

```


What is his id number in your system? In mine he is 4.

``` sql

update students set StudentName = 'Steve' where StudentId = 4;

```

Rerun your query - did his name get changed?

---

# Dropped class

Brandon isn't cutting it in the Jazz class and has decided to drop.

``` sql

delete from grades where StudentId = 3 and SubjectId = 9;

```


---

# Changing a Table Definition

``` sql

alter table Subjects add column CreditHours Int;

update subjects set CreditHours = 3 where SubjectId <> 10;

select * from subjects;

alter table Subjects drop column CreditHours;

```

# Making results Human friendly

So far we have been content using the computer friendly id columns to work through our examples. 

Let's take a look at a better way of working with query results.

## Welcome to joins 

``` sql

select * 
	from Grades g
	inner join Students s
		on g.StudentId = s.StudentId
	inner join Subjects C --classes
		on g.SubjectId = c.SubjectId
		;

```


---

# Can we make this better?

``` sql

select s.StudentName
	,c.SubjectName
	,g.Grade 
	from Grades g
	inner join Students s
		on g.StudentId = s.StudentId
	inner join Subjects c --classes
		on g.SubjectId = c.SubjectId
		;

```

---

# Maybe one more tweak

``` sql


select s.StudentName as "Student Name"
	,c.SubjectName as "Class"
	,g.Grade as 'Result'
	from Grades g
	inner join Students s
		on g.StudentId = s.StudentId
	inner join Subjects C --classes
		on g.SubjectId = c.SubjectId
		;

```
