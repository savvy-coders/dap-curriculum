# Extract, Translate, and Load

The formal process used in Data Warehouse environments for gathering, cleaning and storing data to be used for later analysis. 

This process provides a framework that can be used in Data Analytics and reporting over time.

# Ingesting data using DB Browser

1. Create a new database - I am calling mine `cmspdp.sqlite`
1. Use the File / Import command and select `plan information sample.txt`
1. Stop - notice anything wrong
1. Set your import prferences
    1. Name your table (you don't want spaces)
    1. Column names
    1. Field seperator
    1. Quote character
1. Now you can run the import.

# Reviewing your data

What do you notice first?

I notice the repeating values.

This is sometimes the correct answer - only you can decided. I chose to normalize this data.

# Second issue

The plan id and segment id have been converted to integers. How can this cause a problem?

Integers can't store leading zeros. 

This means we cannot link from our cleaned table to our source table if we let this stand.

# Exploring using the "don't detect option"

This feature is unique to SQLite. The table created by this method does not have data types. 

Crazy!

No data types. 

Yet this is perfect for a staging table. 

# Let's create a table from what we have learned so far. 

``` sql

The process of Extract, Load and Translate is a competing paradigm for rapid discovery. 

This method is preferred when using the full versions of Tableau and PowerBI to connect to APIs directly, Load the data into the workbook, and then do your cleaning and transformation in the reporting tool.
