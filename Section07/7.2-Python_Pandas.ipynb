    "## What is Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "- An open-source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks. \n",
    "- Built on top of NumPy which provides support for multi-dimensional arrays.\n",
    "- References both “Panel Data” and “Python Data Analysis”\n",
    "- The name Pandas is derived from the word \"Panel Data\"\n",
    "- Created by Wes McKinney in 2008\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pandas & NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "- NumPy is a library that adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays\n",
    "- Pandas is a high-level data manipulation tool that is built on the NumPy package\n",
    "- Pandas offers an in-memory 2d table object called a DataFrame\n",
    "- A DataFrame is structured like a table or spreadsheet -- with rows and columns\n",
    "- There are a few functions that exist in NumPy that we use specifically on Pandas DataFrames\n",
    "- Just as the \"ndarray\" is the foundation of NumPy, the \"Series\" is the core object of Pandas\n",
    "- NumPy consumes less memory than Pandas, and is faster than Pandas\n",
    "- These two libraries are the best libraries for data science applications\n",
    "- Pandas mainly works with tabular data, whereas NumPy works with numerical data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pandas & Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks offer a good environment for using pandas to do data exploration and modeling, but pandas can also be used in text editors just as easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks give us the ability to execute code in a particular cell as opposed to running the entire file. This saves a lot of time when working with large datasets and complex transformations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks also provide an easy way to visualize pandas’ DataFrames and plots.\n"

    "Pandas can perform five significant steps required for processing and analysis of data, irrespective of the origin of the data, -- load, manipulate, prepare, model, and analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s cool about Pandas is that it takes data (like a CSV or TSV file, or a SQL database) and creates a Python object with rows and columns called a 'data frame' that looks very similar to table in statistical software (think Excel).\n",

    "- With the index argument, you can name your own labels for the indexes of your series\n",
    "- When you have created labels, you can access an item by referring to the label\n",
